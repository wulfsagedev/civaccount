# /rollout-council $ARGUMENTS

You are running the full per-council rollout playbook on **$ARGUMENTS** — bringing it to the same North-Star standard Bradford meets.

**Ground rule (NORTH-STAR.md §2 principle #3):** Every rendered value must appear verbatim in a linkable public document from the council's own website or a GOV.UK / ONS / DEFRA / DfT / Ofsted / LGBCE publication. No peer averages, no year-on-year deltas, no per-capita comparators, no 5-year arithmetic. Strip anything else.

## Before you start

## ⛔ DEPTH OVER BREADTH — read this first every time

This skill runs the FULL 14-phase playbook on ONE council, end to end, before anything else happens. No shortcuts. No "1 reserves screenshot to get them on the watchlist and I'll come back for the rest". No breadth-first sweeps.

Forbidden thought patterns to watch for:
- "Let me just add this to the screenshot watchlist first." → Stop.
- "I'll do Phase 5b / 5c / 6 in a follow-up commit." → Stop. Do them now.
- "The pay-policy PDF is blocked, let me skip Phase 1 for it." → Either solve the fetch or mark the whole council deferred.

**Checklist (must all be checked before opening the paired PRs):**
- [ ] Phase 0 inventory.json
- [ ] Phase 1 all archived PDFs + sha256 + meta.json (NOT just SoA — also pay-policy, MTFS, members' allowances, council-tax decision, any CE/leader archives)
- [ ] Phase 1b PNG rendered for every renderable Tier-3 field (not just reserves)
- [ ] Phase 2 verbatim extraction
- [ ] Phase 3 derivations stripped
- [ ] Phase 3.5 audit-tier1-drift → 0
- [ ] Phase 3.6 link-check-tier4 → 0 broken
- [ ] Phase 4 EVERY rendered `detailed.*` field has field_sources[k] with url + sha256 + page + excerpt + page_image_url
- [ ] Phase 5 validate.mjs → 0 errors
- [ ] Phase 5b ux-audit → 0/0
- [ ] Phase 5c live-site-reality-check → 3/3 verbatim
- [ ] Phase 5d screenshot-parity → ✓ with multiple screenshots
- [ ] Phase 6 AUDIT.md + manifests/<slug>.json
- [ ] Phase 7 council added to STRICT_COUNCILS, both paired PRs opened + merged

If ANY box is unchecked, the council is not done. Don't open the PR. Don't move on.

If time is constrained, do fewer councils — never cut phases.

1. **Read these documents in full** (they supersede any prior conversation context):
   - [`/NORTH-STAR.md`](/NORTH-STAR.md) — the standard
   - [`/COUNCIL-ROLLOUT-PLAYBOOK.md`](/COUNCIL-ROLLOUT-PLAYBOOK.md) — the 14-phase process
   - [`/scripts/council-research/ROLLOUT-LESSONS.md`](/scripts/council-research/ROLLOUT-LESSONS.md) — **continuous self-learning log**. Read this BEFORE starting. Fetch-method table by site (curl / puppeteer / Wayback), reserves-scalar "General Fund vs Total Usable" trap, excerpt-authoring rules, the deferred-councils list, AND the **depth-over-breadth enforcement** rule captured after Batch-10.
   - [`/docs/PROGRESS.md`](/docs/PROGRESS.md) — what Bradford got stripped (apply the same strips here)

2. **Check current state of $ARGUMENTS:**
   ```bash
   cat scripts/council-research/status/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS).json 2>/dev/null || echo "no prior status — starting from Phase 0"
   ```

3. **Set up tracking.** Use TodoWrite to list all 9 phases as pending todos. Mark each in_progress as you start it and completed when it's done. One in_progress at a time.

4. **Create paired branches on both repos:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/owenfisher/Projects/CivAccount/V3.0
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b rollout/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS)
   cd src/data/councils
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b rollout/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS)
   ```

## Execute the 9 phases

Work through each phase from the playbook without skipping. Each phase has its own acceptance criteria; don't move on until it's met.

### Phase 0 — Inventory
Probe the 11 URL patterns per playbook §Phase 0. Write `inventory.json` listing every candidate source. If $ARGUMENTS is on a Cloudflare-blocked site (like Camden), note Tier 4 candidates explicitly.

### Phase 1 — Archive
Run `node scripts/council-research/02-archive.mjs --council=$ARGUMENTS`. Handle Cloudflare blocks via Wayback. Every archived file needs sha256 + `_meta.json`.

### Phase 1b — Page-image PNGs
Create `scripts/council-research/specs/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS)-images.json` listing every Tier 3 PDF page that carries a rendered value. Run `node scripts/council-research/render-page-images.mjs --spec=<path>`.

### Phase 2 — Extract
For each archived document: `pdftotext -layout -f N -l N <file>`, quote the exact line in a `field_sources` entry's `excerpt`. For Tier 2 CSVs: parse and aggregate.

### Phase 3 — Strip (CRITICAL — this is where Bradford lost the most data)

Apply the **Bradford strip checklist** from `docs/PROGRESS.md#reference`:

**Must-strip data-level fields (unless page-level sourced):**
- `performance_kpis` (entire array)
- `service_outcomes.housing.*`
- `service_outcomes.population_served`
- `service_outcomes.libraries`
- `service_outcomes.adult_social_care.cqc_rating`
- `service_spending` (sub-category amounts)
- `chief_executive_total_remuneration` (unless directly published)
- Any collection rates / homes delivery % fields

**Don't re-introduce derivations:** peer averages, YoY deltas, per-capita comparators, multi-year changes. UI-level strips are already applied across all components; if you find yourself adding a `Calculated` or `Comparison` label, stop and strip instead.

### Phase 3.5 — Tier-1 drift check (MANDATORY, added 2026-04-23)

```bash
node /tmp/audit-tier1-drift.mjs   # or scripts/validate/audit-tier1-drift.mjs once promoted
```

Must report **zero drift** for $ARGUMENTS. Compares:
- `src/data/population.ts` entry → `parsed-population.csv` row
- `council_tax.band_d_2021..2025` → `parsed-area-band-d.csv` columns
- `budget.*` (education/transport/social_care/public_health/housing/cultural/environmental/planning/central_services) → `RA_Part1_LA_Data.csv` `*tot` columns
- `budget.total_service` must equal the sum of the 11 category fields
- `budget.net_current` → RA Part 1 `netcurrtot`

If drift found → update the TS values to match the CSV. No exceptions.

### Phase 3.6 — Tier-4 link check (MANDATORY, added 2026-04-23)

```bash
node /tmp/link-check-tier4.mjs   # or scripts/validate/link-check-tier4.mjs once promoted
```

Every Tier-4 URL in $ARGUMENTS's `field_sources` must return HTTP 200 (or a
documented 403 HEAD-bot block that works in-browser).

Also spot-check the current CE and council leader names via WebSearch.
If either is stale → update the TS scalar and the `field_source.excerpt`/`accessed`.

### Phase 4 — Populate
Every surviving value gets a full `field_sources[k]` entry per NORTH-STAR §4:
`{ url, title, accessed, data_year, tier, extraction_method, sha256_at_access | archive_exempt, page, excerpt, page_image_url }`.

PDF URLs must include `#page=N` for direct-to-page linking.

### Phase 5 — Structural validators
```bash
node scripts/validate/validate.mjs
node scripts/validate/audit-north-star.mjs --council=$ARGUMENTS
```
Both must report 0 errors / 0 gaps. Add $ARGUMENTS to `STRICT_COUNCILS` in `tier-classification.mjs` once it passes.

### Phase 5b — Live browser UX sweep (MANDATORY)

```bash
# Start dev server (or reuse if running)
# Then:
node scripts/council-research/ux-audit.mjs --council=$ARGUMENTS
```

Output must be:
```
✓ 0 violations — $ARGUMENTS passes Phase 5b
  (0 unwrapped numbers · 0 derived/comparator values)
```

If violations appear:
- **UNWRAPPED** numeric values → wrap in SourceAnnotation in the component, or strip the source data
- **DERIVED / COMPARATORS** → strip the rendering, don't re-label

Re-run until 0 / 0. No exceptions.

**Also visually spot-check** — load the council page in the live browser, click 3 random values, verify each popover's source URL opens a specific page of a real public document (not a landing page).

### Phase 5c — Live-site reality check (MANDATORY, added 2026-04-23)

```bash
node scripts/council-research/live-site-reality-check.mjs --council=$ARGUMENTS
```

Pick 3 rendered values for $ARGUMENTS; extract each archived PDF via `pdftotext
-layout`; run `grep -c -F <value>`. Pass criterion: **3/3 verbatim hits.**

If 0/3 or 1/3 or 2/3 — the rendered value is not verbatim in the cited source.
Either update the rendered value to match the PDF, or strip the field.

### Phase 5d — Screenshot parity (MANDATORY, added 2026-04-24)

```bash
node scripts/validate/screenshot-parity.mjs 2>&1 | grep -E "^[✓✗] $ARGUMENTS"
```

Every council must end the rollout with **≥1 page_image_url** declared in
`field_sources`, every referenced PNG present on disk, and every `excerpt`
appearing verbatim (after whitespace/unicode canonicalisation) in the
archived source. Pass criterion: **line starts with ✓**.

If missing:
1. Pick a renderable TS field whose value appears verbatim in an archived
   document (SoA, pay-policy, or council news/Wayback HTML).
2. Render the PNG via `node scripts/council-research/render-page-images.mjs`
   (PDF source) or `puppeteer.goto()` (HTML/live source).
3. Add `page_image_url`, `page`, `excerpt` to the relevant `field_sources`
   entry. If the current URL is Tier-4 live-page, upgrade to Tier-3 by
   pointing `url` at the archived file (with `#page=N` for PDFs).

Re-run until ✓. No exceptions. **This phase was added after the 2026-04-24
audit found only Bradford, Kent, and Camden had screenshot evidence shipped
to `main` — 19 other councils rendered popovers with no visual proof.**

### Phase 6 — Document
Write `src/data/councils/docs/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS | uppercase)-AUDIT.md` using the Bradford template:
- Datasheet for Datasets (13 sections per Gebru 2021)
- Per-field register (Tier × field × sha256 × source URL)
- `manifests/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS).json` reproducibility manifest

### Phase 7 — Ship
Two paired PRs:

**Data repo (`civaccount-data`):**
- Updated TypeScript record
- Archived PDFs + `_meta.json` + `images/*.png`
- `docs/<COUNCIL>-AUDIT.md` + `manifests/<slug>.json`

**Public repo (`civaccount`):**
- Any UI changes discovered during Phase 5b
- Updated `status/$(slugify $ARGUMENTS).json` with `phase_7_ship: true`
- Updated `docs/PROGRESS.md` moving council from 🟡 → 🟢

Use `gh pr create` with a body that lists:
- Which Tier 1-3 sources were verified
- Which Tier 4 sources were accepted (with archive_exempt rationale)
- **Which fields were stripped + why** (this is the most important section)
- Live browser sweep result: `0 / 0`
- North-star audit result: `0 / 5 gaps`

## Acceptance — don't mark complete unless ALL of these pass

- [ ] All 14 phases done (0, 1, 1b, 2, 3, **3.5**, **3.6**, 4, 5, 5b, **5c**, **5d**, 6, 7); status/<slug>.json shows each phase ✓
- [ ] `audit-north-star --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **0/5 gaps**
- [ ] `audit-tier1-drift --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **0 cells drifted** (Phase 3.5 — added 2026-04-23)
- [ ] `link-check-tier4 --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **0 broken URLs** (Phase 3.6 — added 2026-04-23)
- [ ] `ux-audit --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **0 / 0 violations** (Phase 5b)
- [ ] `live-site-reality-check --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **3/3 verbatim** (Phase 5c — added 2026-04-23)
- [ ] `screenshot-parity --council=$ARGUMENTS` → **✓ line** (Phase 5d — added 2026-04-24)
- [ ] `tier-classification` validator 0 errors (council added to STRICT_COUNCILS)
- [ ] CE + Leader names verified current via WebSearch cross-check (Phase 3.6)
- [ ] AUDIT.md (Datasheet for Datasets, 13 sections per Gebru 2021) + `manifests/<slug>.json` shipped
- [ ] Both PRs merged to `main`

**If any of Phase 3.5, 3.6, 5c, or 5d fails — the council is NOT North-Star
complete, even if the structural validators pass. Zero drift, 1:1 screenshot
proof. Added after the Leeds drift spot-check of 2026-04-23 (187 cells +
12 URLs + 2 stale CE names) and the 2026-04-24 Bradford-only screenshot
regression (19 of 22 councils rendered popovers with no visual proof).**

If any one of these fails, the council is **not** North-Star complete.

## Progress update

At the end of the rollout, reply to the user with:
1. Phase-by-phase summary (what was done)
2. **Exact list of what got stripped + why** (this builds trust — show your working)
3. List of anything you couldn't do + why (if any)
4. Link to the merged PRs
5. Updated `docs/PROGRESS.md` row for $ARGUMENTS

**Never mark a council complete without passing Phase 5b with 0 / 0.** That is the hard floor.
