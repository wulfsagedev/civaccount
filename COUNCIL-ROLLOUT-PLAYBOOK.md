# Per-council rollout playbook

**Adopted 2026-04-22 after Bradford became the first fully North-Star-compliant reference council. Every council added to the verified set from here runs through these 9 phases without deviation.** If you're a future session picking this up cold, this is your manual.

Bradford is the template. Everything done to Bradford in April 2026 is codified below as the workflow. No step is optional.

Companion docs:
- [`NORTH-STAR.md`](NORTH-STAR.md) — the standards (what "done" means)
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — the sequence (which councils, in what order)
- [`docs/PROGRESS.md`](docs/PROGRESS.md) — running state per council
- [`scripts/council-research/README.md`](scripts/council-research/README.md) — tooling

## Quick-reference: the nine phases

| Phase | Name | Typical time | Output |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------ |
| 0 | Inventory | 15 min | `pdfs/council-pdfs/<slug>/inventory.json` |
| 1 | Archive | 20 min | Local PDFs + `_meta.json` + Wayback URLs |
| 1b | Page-image generation | 10 min | PNGs under `images/` |
| 2 | Extract | 30 min | `extracted-values.json` per field |
| 3 | Cross-check + strip | 45 min | Stripped fields + `*-AUDIT.md` draft |
| 4 | Populate | 20 min | Updated TypeScript data file |
| 5 | Validator suite | 5 min | All CI validators pass |
| **5b** | **Live browser UX sweep** ← NEW | 30 min | `0` unwrapped numeric values |
| 6 | Document | 30 min | Full `<COUNCIL>-AUDIT.md` |
| 7 | Ship | 10 min | One PR each on public + data repos |

Total: ~3.5 hours per council for competent human-supervised run. Automated rollout won't start until Camden + Kent have run through this template (per ROADMAP Phase F).

---

## Phase 0 — Inventory

Find every document the council publishes that might contain a rendered field.

### URL patterns to probe

For each council, check every one of these (per NORTH-STAR §6 Phase 0):

- `<council>.gov.uk/finances-and-spending/` (or `/finance`, `/budgets`, `/financial-information`)
- `<council>.gov.uk/statement-of-accounts/`
- `<council>.gov.uk/pay-policy-statement/` or `/chief-officer-pay/`
- `<council>.gov.uk/councillors-allowances/` or `/members-allowances/`
- `<council>.gov.uk/mtfs/` or `/medium-term-financial-strategy/`
- `<council>.gov.uk/cabinet/` or `/portfolio-holders/`
- `democracy.<council>.gov.uk/documents/` (moderngov pattern)
- `opendata.<council>.gov.uk/` (Socrata/CKAN/ArcGIS)
- `datahub.<council>.gov.uk/` (some councils)
- `<council>.gov.uk/spending-over-500/` or `/invoices-over-250/`
- 360Giving registry (for grants)
- `data.gov.uk` — search for datasets published by the council

### Output

`src/data/councils/pdfs/council-pdfs/<slug>/inventory.json` with one entry per candidate URL — status, likely document_type, initial tier guess.

---

## Phase 1 — Archive

### For each inventory URL:

1. **Download** to `pdfs/council-pdfs/<slug>/<doc-name>.pdf` (or .csv, .xlsx)
2. **Sha256** the bytes
3. **Write `_meta.json`** sibling with:
   ```json
   {
     "source_url": "...",
     "publisher": "...",
     "document_type": "pay-policy | statement-of-accounts | mtfs | ...",
     "fiscal_year": "2025-26",
     "fetched": "ISO datetime",
     "sha256": "hex64",
     "content_type": "application/pdf",
     "content_length": 0,
     "wayback_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/...",
     "licence": "Open Government Licence v3.0"
   }
   ```
4. **Trigger Wayback snapshot** via SavePageNow API. Record returned URL.

### If a URL is bot-blocked (Cloudflare / 403):

- Record `archive_exempt: "cloudflare_blocked"` in the meta
- Still attempt Wayback (IA often succeeds where we fail — different origin, different UA heuristics)
- Flag in the AUDIT file's "Known archive gaps" section

### Tool

```bash
node scripts/council-research/02-archive.mjs --council=<Name>
```

Idempotent — safe to re-run. Skips files whose sha256 matches the stored meta.

---

## Phase 1b — Pre-generate visual evidence

For each Tier 3 archived PDF, render the exact page the value lives on to a PNG.

### Spec file pattern

`scripts/council-research/specs/<slug>-images.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "council": "Bradford",
    "field": "chief_executive_salary",
    "pdf": "pay-policy-2025-26.pdf",
    "page": 11,
    "value": "£217,479",
    "note": "Senior Management Structure & Salary Ranges (Appendix B)"
  }
]
```

### Tool

```bash
node scripts/council-research/render-page-images.mjs --spec=scripts/council-research/specs/<slug>-images.json
```

Generates PNGs at 150 DPI (~300 KB each) into `pdfs/council-pdfs/<slug>/images/`.

### UI contract

Each `field_sources[k].page_image_url` points at `/archive/<slug>/images/<field>-p<page>.png`. The `/archive/` route handler serves from the archive folder with 1-year-immutable cache.

---

## Phase 2 — Extract

For each archived document type, run the matching extraction routine:

- **PDF** → `pdftotext -layout -f N -l N <file>` → regex match the line, record page + verbatim excerpt
- **CSV / XLSX** → parse, extract by council's row, record column header
- **Socrata JSON** → SoQL query with explicit aggregate, record the query
- **HTML** (accessible) → cheerio parse; (bot-blocked) → manual read + screenshot

### Output

`pdfs/council-pdfs/<slug>/extracted-values.json` — one entry per field with:
- source file sha256 (W3C PROV Entity)
- extraction_method
- page number + verbatim excerpt (PDF) or column + row index (CSV)
- extraction script version (commit SHA)

---

## Phase 3 — Cross-check + strip

### Cross-check each extracted value

1. **Tier 1 cross-check** — does the value appear in any Tier 1 CSV we have? If yes, must match exactly.
2. **Benford's Law** — once validator is live (ROADMAP Phase E). z > 1.96 = flag.
3. **YoY outlier** — > 30% change from last known year → human review.
4. **Sum consistency** — sub-totals match totals.

### The strip rule

**If a value can't be traced to a primary `.gov.uk` publication (Tier 1-4) OR confirmed via secondary (Tier 5), it does not render.**

Strip means: remove the value from the council's data entry. The UI either omits the card entirely or shows a `DataValidationNotice`. 

**Don't keep values "for completeness" — keep the standard.**

Typical strips on first audit:
- `performance_kpis` entries with no Tier 1 backing (CQC, council tax collection, homes delivery) — strip
- `service_outcomes.housing` if not in a Tier 1 dataset we track — strip
- `service_outcomes.population_served` duplicating the top-level `population` field — strip the dupe
- Any value contradicting another Tier 1 value (e.g. 96% here vs 93% from DfT RDC) — strip the duplicate, keep the one with Tier 1 provenance

---

## Phase 4 — Populate

For every extracted value that survived Phase 3:

### Full `field_sources` entry per NORTH-STAR §4

```typescript
chief_executive_salary: {
  url: "https://.../pay-policy-2025-26.pdf#page=11",
  title: "Pay Policy Statement 2025-26 — Senior Management Structure & Salary Ranges (Appendix B)",
  accessed: "2026-04-22",
  data_year: "2025-26",
  tier: 3,
  extraction_method: "pdf_page",
  sha256_at_access: "545774...c8b4",
  page: 11,
  excerpt: "Chief Executive  CEX  £217,479",
  page_image_url: "/archive/bradford/images/chief_executive_salary-p11.png",
}
```

### PDF URL rule — always include `#page=N`

Readers tapping "Open source" should land on the exact page, never on a cover-page hunt. Tested to work across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and moderngov.

### Tier 4 entries (live pages / bot-blocked)

```typescript
chief_executive: {
  url: "https://bradford.gov.uk/.../chief-executive-...",
  title: "Corporate Management Team — Chief Executive",
  accessed: "2026-04-22",
  data_year: "current",
  tier: 4,
  extraction_method: "manual_read",
  archive_exempt: "live_page",
  excerpt: "Chief Executive — Lorraine O'Donnell — ceo.admin@bradford.gov.uk",
}
```

---

## Phase 5 — Validator suite

```bash
node scripts/validate/validate.mjs
node scripts/validate/audit-north-star.mjs --council=<Name>
```

Must show:
- `source-truth`: 0 errors (every Tier 1 value matches source CSV)
- `field-source-years`: 0 errors (every entry has `data_year`)
- `tier-classification`: 0 errors (every entry has `tier` + `extraction_method`)
- `audit-north-star`: **0/5 gaps**
- `link-check`: no silent 404s on field_sources URLs

If any fail — fix or strip the offending value.

---

## Phase 5b — Live browser UX sweep ← NEW, MANDATORY

**Derived from Bradford UX-audit lessons. Do not skip. Structural validators are necessary but not sufficient — values can be rendered without SourceAnnotation wrapping, which silently bypasses all provenance.**

### Steps

1. Start dev server
   ```bash
   # from .claude/launch.json "dev" config
   npm run dev  # or use mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_start
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/council/<slug>`

3. Run the **unwrapped-numbers sweep** (copy-paste into browser console or preview_eval):
   ```javascript
   (() => {
     const main = document.querySelector('main') || document.body;
     const walker = document.createTreeWalker(main, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT, null);
     const numberRegex = /(£[\d,]+(?:\.\d+)?(?:\s*(?:million|billion|bn|m))?|\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+(?:\.\d+)?|\d+\.\d+%|\d{3,}\b)/;
     const results = [];
     let node;
     while ((node = walker.nextNode())) {
       const text = node.textContent.trim();
       if (!text) continue;
       const m = text.match(numberRegex);
       if (!m) continue;
       let el = node.parentElement;
       let wrapped = false;
       let depth = 0;
       while (el && depth < 15) {
         if (el.getAttribute?.('role') === 'button' &&
             el.getAttribute('aria-label')?.startsWith('Source:')) {
           wrapped = true; break;
         }
         if (el.getAttribute?.('role') === 'dialog') { wrapped = 'in-dialog'; break; }
         el = el.parentElement; depth++;
       }
       if (wrapped !== true && wrapped !== 'in-dialog') {
         results.push({ text: text.slice(0, 80) });
       }
     }
     return results.filter(r =>
       !/^20\d\d$/.test(r.text) &&
       !/^\d{4}-\d{2}$/.test(r.text) &&
       !/^£\d+k/.test(r.text) &&
       !/^\d+ [A-Z][a-z]+ \d{4}$/.test(r.text)
     );
   })()
   ```

4. **Every result is a violation.** For each:
   - **Is it a real data point?** → wrap it in `<SourceAnnotation>` with the correct `getProvenance(...)` call in the component
   - **Is it decorative / label / narrative where the value is already wrapped elsewhere?** → leave, but document
   - **Is it unsourceable?** → strip the underlying data field + update the component to render nothing (or a `DataValidationNotice`)

5. Re-run the sweep. Iterate until **0 results**.

### Ancillary visual checks (required before ship)

- **Tap the first numeric value in the hero.** Popover opens. Source URL points to a specific resource (not a landing page). Tier badge visible.
- **Tap a value with a page_image_url.** Lightbox opens, popover closes, PNG renders the expected page.
- **Tap "Open source" on a Tier 3 PDF value.** Browser opens PDF directly at the right page.
- **Click a supplier drill-down.** Verify helper copy names the specific supplier/recipient the reader should search for.

### Automated version (coming)

`scripts/council-research/ux-audit.mjs --council=<Name>` — wraps the sweep above, starts a dev server, navigates, reports violations. To be built in ROADMAP Phase E.

---

## Phase 6 — Document (Datasheet for Datasets)

Write `docs/<COUNCIL>-AUDIT.md` in the data repo following Gebru et al. *Communications of the ACM* 2021:

1. Motivation
2. Composition
3. Collection process (source table — Tier × field × sha256)
4. Preprocessing
5. Uses
6. Distribution (OGL v3)
7. Maintenance

Plus a per-field register and a change log.

### Reproducibility manifest

`manifests/<slug>.json` listing every archived file + sha256 + source URL + fiscal_year + every page image + verified value. Anyone cloning the repo should be able to re-derive all rendered values by running `npm run reproduce -- --council=<Name>` (once built).

---

## Phase 7 — Ship

One PR per repo, paired:

### Data repo (`civaccount-data`)
- Updated council data entry (TypeScript file under `src/data/councils/`)
- Archived PDFs + `_meta.json` + `images/*.png`
- `docs/<COUNCIL>-AUDIT.md`
- `manifests/<slug>.json`

### Public repo (`civaccount`)
- Any component changes discovered during Phase 5b browser audit
- Any new `field_sources` schema uses
- Updated `scripts/council-research/specs/<slug>-images.json`
- Updated `scripts/council-research/status/<slug>.json` (mark `phase_7_ship: true, pr_url: "..."`)
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` moved from 🟡 → 🟢 complete

### PR must call out

- Which Tier 1-3 sources were verified
- Which Tier 4-5 sources were accepted (with archive_exempt rationale)
- Which fields were stripped + why (this is the most important section — Bradford stripped 3 fields)
- Live browser sweep → 0 unwrapped numbers
- North-star audit → 0/5 gaps

---

## What Bradford taught us (codified into the phases above)

1. **Structural provenance isn't sufficient** — Bradford had North-Star-compliant `field_sources` AND every rendered number wrapped correctly, BUT we only found the latter by live-browser audit. (Phase 5b is new because of this.)
2. **Some cards use drill-down branches** that bypass provenance wrapping — check both branches in the same component.
3. **Partial-year / change-in-seat artifacts** cause councillor-count confusion (LGBCE says 90, publication lists 107 rows). Always use `total_councillors` for display count.
4. **Duplicate fields contradict each other** — Bradford's `performance_kpis` said road condition 96%, `service_outcomes.roads` said 93%. Strip the duplicate even if both "look right."
5. **`src/data/population.ts` can drift from the Tier 1 CSV.** Spot-check every council's population against `parsed-population.csv` on Phase 5.
6. **FAQ narrative text embeds numbers too** — the "Common questions" card paraphrases hero values into sentences. Each number embedded in prose still needs wrapping.
7. **PDF URLs must include `#page=N`** — users landing at page 1 of a 170-page Statement of Accounts is a trust violation. If we know the page (and we always should, post-Phase 2), the URL includes it.
8. **Tier 2 aggregates need helper copy** — Bradford's datahub doesn't support URL filters, so when the user taps "Open source ledger", we tell them the exact supplier / recipient name to Ctrl-F for. Without that copy, the user lands unprepared.
9. **Popover + lightbox must not layer** — close the popover before opening the lightbox or readers see them stacked.
10. **A "verified" council on the structural audit can still have 33 unwrapped numbers.** Don't mark a council complete until the browser sweep is 0.

---

## Order of operations (commit cadence)

One logical change per commit. Don't batch. Bradford's full rollout produced these PRs, in order — same cadence applies to every council:

1. Phase 0-1 archival: one PR to the data repo with PDFs + meta
2. Phase 1b page images: one PR to the data repo with `images/` + spec file
3. Phase 4 populate: one PR to the data repo with the updated TS record
4. Phase 5b component wrapping fixes: one PR to the public repo
5. Phase 6 documentation: committed alongside (3) — `<COUNCIL>-AUDIT.md` + `manifests/<slug>.json`

Or — for velocity — phases 0-6 can land in two paired PRs (public + data). Bradford's rollout shipped in 8 PRs over 3 days; future councils should need fewer because the template is fixed.

---

## Progression guard

**Do not begin Phase 0 for a new council until:**
- The previous council is through Phase 7 (merged)
- That council's `status/<slug>.json` has `phase_7_ship: true`
- `audit-north-star` still reports 0/5 for all STRICT_COUNCILS
- `tier-classification` validator reports 0 errors for all STRICT_COUNCILS

This prevents regression — each new council can only inherit from a green baseline.

---

## If you're a future session

1. Read `/NORTH-STAR.md` §1–6 first. Everything else is downstream.
2. Then read this playbook.
3. Then check `docs/PROGRESS.md` to see which council to pick up.
4. Open the target council's `status/<slug>.json` to see exactly which phase to resume from.
5. Do not skip Phase 5b. Do not ship without it.
